# Team-97-Robotics--Bionic-Beef
CRLS Robotics Team

As the lead developer and project manager of the Code Team, I was responsible for implementing various functionalities for our robot. This ranged from simple programming of the drive train to complicated implementation of PID Control in order to automatically balance on a moving platform during the autonomous period of the 2023 FRC Competition. Our team saw huge improvements during competition season in 2023, especially compared to the previous years; we placed 16th (out of 40) in our first event, an impressive feat considering our small team and lack of historical success.

My responsibilities as a captain of my own sub-team were very impactful for me. Learning how to manage projects and maintain high team morale, especially during the stressful environment of a competitive event, helped me develop my leadership and communication skills. From a technical standpoint, I grew a lot as well, being introduced to new challenges such as working with various hardware components and having to learn the ins and outs of git version control.
